# IEDFoodStorage [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jlyon1/IEDFoodStorage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jlyon1/IEDFoodStorage)

This repository contains the source code for the web facing portion of our IED food inventory project. Includes a frontend and a backend

## Goals
- Enable Users to enter foods that they have in stock and place it on a specific location for tracking in their pantry
- Utilize online databases such as eatbydate and allow user input to track expiration dates
- Automatically notify users on expiration of food items
- Provide an API to allow external sensors to expire foods in the database
- Enable users to mark food as eaten/expired/removed

### Stretch Goals

- Use shopping lists to manage what the user should buy/stock shelves from what they did buy
- Generate a shopping list for expired foods
- Add a saved food list w/expiration times
